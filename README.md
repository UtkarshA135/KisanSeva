# KisanSeva - one stop for Indian farmers

This is the official code repository for _Code Monks_ . This _simple, light weight mobile application built in Flutter_ was developed during Accelathon 2.0
the online the annual inter college hackathon and also selected for IFFPC conducted by Sikkim Manipal University.

### Overview

_Joyce Meyer said, “I believe that the greatest gift you can give to your family and the world is a healthy you”_.

_If a person stays healthy physically, he will stay healthy mentally too. Physical and mental health is linked fundamentally. If we are able to keep our body fit and healthy by taking the right food and doing physical activates regularly, our body will definitely help us to deal with daily stress._ 

_Keeping in mind above points we have decided to make Healthician .Healthify is focused to cover almost all aspects related to Healthcare in a single app.Healthician has 8_ _categories which relate to covid detection through lung x-ray, Yoga posture correction, Doctor Patient interaction, BMI calculation, Donate, Symptoms Detector , Medicine_ _Reminder and Mental Health_

### _Challenges we ran into_
_The most challenging tasks we faced for this project were tflite implementation,using posnet technology to detect the poses,using dialog flow using infermedica api and flutter_ _animations and as well as integrating push notifications was a toil_.

### Technology used

* Flutter
* Tensorflow
* Weather API
* Firebase
* Firestore
* Cloud Messaging
* Firebase Authentication
* Rest APIs
* Google Teachable Machine

### Usage

_In order to run the application on your local device make sure to have flutter environment setup on your local device_

[Flutter setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDnqXmLSqtg "Video")

_Clone the repo and open it in any text editor - VS Code for example_

_Connect your mobile in USB Debug mode_

_write in terminal "flutter run"_

### Tracks used
_Agriculture :-  Since farmers are facing a lot of issues and there is protest going on which has worsened the situation so we decided to come up with a smart solution to the problem by including features like Rent tools and Smart connect to the Mandi which will surely propel the growth of farmers._

### Proposed add on features
 
To remove the issue of providing statical data in crop prediction feature we are thinking of integrating the app with an IOT model where perhaps a Node MCU model will collect all data like soil pH , Rainfall etc and send it to the real-time database and using the ML model built in the Goggle Collab we can predict the crop.
Also in Feed feature we didn't get any API which would provide news solely related to Agro industry so we are working on that.
